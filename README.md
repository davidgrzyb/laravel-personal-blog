This is the source code of my personal blog. This project serves as a place to test and learn new tech, with the most recent change being a move from Bootstrap to Tailwind!

It currently uses the following:

- [Laravel 7](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x).
- [cnvs](https://cnvs.io/).
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).
- [Laravel Mix](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/mix).

The site is currently deployed on a DigitalOcean Droplet via Cloudways. The site has been optimized to get consistently high PageSpeed scores, I have a post about that [here](https://davidgrzyb.com/100-on-google-pagespeed-insights).
